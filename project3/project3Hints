Some comments on project 3:
Unfortunately it does not run. There is a failure on line 121. ("expected timedistributed_1 to have 3 dimensions,
but got array with shape (114549, 25)")
I asked Fred for help on Friday (2.9.), unfortunately didn't received an answer yet.
I decided to hand it in anyway, because the deadline is tomorrow and I'll be by my grandmother from tomorrow on for
about a week.
I want to emphasize again that I work here for more than 15 hours on this project.
