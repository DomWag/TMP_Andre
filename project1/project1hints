Some hints and comments on project1:
First of all I want to emphasize that I worked for more than 20 hours on this project.
I asked Fred many times for help and received it - thanks. My last email from Friday(2.9.) was unfortunately not
answered yet.
I really stuck at the point to build the c structure. I watched again and again the video
https://youtu.be/MiEKnFyErbQ?t=18m25s and try to figure it out, invest the whole day today, but unfortunately I have no
clue how to solve it.
One way could be on line 86, to save both the start and the end of a span. I didn't had the time to investigate this.

I decided to hand it in anyway, because the deadline is tomorrow and I'll be by my grandmother from tomorrow on for
about a week.
Because of the huge computation time I was not able to really test it, but it should give you the probability of a
parsing.
So one working input would be:
cky_parser -p <sentence>
