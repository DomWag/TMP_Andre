Some hints how to use the programm:
first you have to convert the delivered test and train files of Dutch and Spanish with project2_feat into a scored csv
file.
Therefore you have to change the last line in this programm and type the name of the file which should be convert and
the location of the converted file.
In project2_classifier the actually work is happening:
you have the following possiblies:
1) ner -train -learning_curve scoring_esp_train_big.csv
2) ner -train scoring_esp_train_big.csv
3) ner -test scoring_esp_testa_big.csv
(The last part is the name of the csv file you have created before.)
